# dependabot-approve-bot

A GitHub App that serves only to submit approving Pull Request Reviews for PRs from [Dependabot](https://github.com/apps/dependabot). This enables you to require Pull Request Reviews on your project while also still utilising Dependabot's "automerge" benefits.


### Acknowledgements

This is all but exact replica of Rhys Arkins' [Renovate Approve Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate-approve-bot/) tweaked to work with Dependabot.
